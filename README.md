## üöÄ Introduction

### Overview

The **IC Tester Kit Using Arduino** is a microcontroller-based application designed to test amplifier ICs such as **INA128, INA126, AMP04E** used in electrical tests for automotive parts in your factory. This kit will identify malfunctioning ICs on a board, ensuring that only faulty ICs are replaced, thereby saving time and cost.

> **Note:** This project can be fully tested, run, and developed using Arduino IDE. **There is no need for a complex hardware setup to get started**. The Arduino IDE provides a straightforward platform for writing, testing, and running the IC tester software.

> The project is **open source** and you can use it for your own projects.

### Key Features

1. **IC Functionality Testing**:
   - The system tests the functionality of amplifier ICs.
   - It accurately identifies faulty ICs on the board.

2. **User Interface Interaction**:
   - The system interacts with users through an LCD and buttons.
   - Users can start/stop tests and view test results on the display.

3. **Display Updates**:
   - The display provides real-time test status and results.
   - It shows whether each IC is functional or faulty.

4. **System Control Components**:
   - The system manages various testing components:
     - **Signal Generator**: Provides input signals to the ICs.
     - **Measurement Unit**: Measures output signals from the ICs.
   - Activation and deactivation of these components are handled by the Arduino.

## ‚öô Working

### System Behavior

This IC tester kit primarily involves these main user operations:

1. **Starting the Test**:
   - Use the buttons to initiate the test.
   - The display will guide you through the process.

2. **Running the Test**:
   - The system provides input signals to the ICs and measures their output.
   - If an IC is found faulty, it will be indicated on the display.

3. **Viewing the Results**:
   - The display will show the test results for each IC.
   - Users can see which ICs are functional and which are faulty.

4. **Stopping the Test**:
   - Use the buttons to stop the test.
   - The system will reset and be ready for the next test.

## üñ•Ô∏è PCB Details

The PCB contains several jumpers to configure its operation in specific ways. Here are the detailed descriptions:

1. **Input Voltage Source Selection**:
   - **Jumper 1**: Selects the source of the input voltage for the ICs.
     - **Option 1**: Always 5V input voltage.
       - This option provides a constant 5V to all ICs, ensuring a stable and fixed voltage supply.
     - **Option 2**: Controlled input using 2N2222 transistor.
       - This option allows the input voltage to be controlled dynamically, providing 5V or 0V to each IC as needed. The 2N2222 transistor acts as a switch, enabling precise control over the voltage supplied to each IC.

2. **Supply Voltage Detection**:
   - **Jumper 2**: Detects the supply voltage for each IC (12V or 5V).
     - This jumper utilizes a 2N2222 transistor to detect whether each IC is being supplied with 12V or 5V. This detection mechanism ensures that each IC receives the appropriate voltage for its operation and helps prevent damage due to incorrect voltage levels.

3. **Supply Voltage Selection for the Whole Kit**:
   - **Jumper 3**: Selects the supply voltage for the entire IC tester kit.
     - **Option 1**: Using Arduino (LM1117IMPX-5.0) internal IC.
       - This option uses the LM1117IMPX-5.0 regulator IC on the Arduino board to provide a 5V supply to the entire kit. The LM1117IMPX-5.0 is a low-dropout voltage regulator known for its stable output and high efficiency.
     - **Option 2**: Using LM7805 IC.
       - This option uses the LM7805 regulator IC to provide a 5V supply to the entire kit. The LM7805 is a widely used voltage regulator that offers a reliable 5V output with robust performance.

These jumpers allow the user to configure the IC tester kit to meet specific testing requirements and ensure optimal performance. Properly setting these jumpers is essential for accurate and reliable testing of amplifier ICs.
